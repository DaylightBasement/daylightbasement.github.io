      <description>Rightfully, Beary Arms is a bullet hell roguelite that is about much more than collecting loot, dying and losing everything, then repeating. Carefully choose enemy upgrades against your own, then plan your dungeon crawl tactfully to gun through unique factions of enemies, strategically preserving loot after death.
Video not supportedBeary likes to fight. His arsenal is vast but displaced throughout the galaxy. Collect and use powerful weapons, each with their own unique characteristics and learning curves.</description>
