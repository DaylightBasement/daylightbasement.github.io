      <description>Donâ€™t be fooled by its cuteness. Rightfully, Beary Arms is a bullet hell, roguelite that will punish and reward you. Augment weapons to create unique weapon builds, pick rewards as you explore levels, alter mechanics to your benefit and peril, fight, die, become stronger, and do it all over again.
Manipulate the rules of the game by collecting runtimes, and calamities. Make things easier for Beary, harder for the enemy, or even harder for you.</description>
