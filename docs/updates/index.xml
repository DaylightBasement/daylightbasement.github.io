      <description>Known Issues Keyboard and mouse can only be used if the controller is unplugged. If controller is plugged in, it takes priority Hot swapping controller/keyboard will probably not work. We have only tested an Xbox controller Framerate isn&amp;rsquo;t great. We are doing some things not as optimally as we should be, we&amp;rsquo;ve tested on gtx 970 and that seems to play fine. We should have a fix for this soon There is no quit button, so alt-tab or alt+F4 to close the game game only supports 16:10 and 16:9 resolutions UI Overall Improved look of health bars Holster added back to the player hud Improved minimap look Updated a lot of music Fixed screen affects in menu when loading in the the game for the first time Added a notification for when the player runs out of Radar Jam Fixed travel events Player can no longer re-board visited nodes Weapons and Items Overall Fixed a bug around weapons being duplicated with a controller Calamities Now reset upon death Pro͞oves Reduced cost of all Pro͞oves to 1 RunTime Pro͞oves granted within a given run are now called RunTimes Now reset upon death (Pro͞oves gained still carry over from run to run) Radar Jam Reduced the amount of starting radarjam from 250 to 150 Reduced the amount picked up from 100 to 50 PPSH41 Increased reserved ammo amount from 100 to 850 Reduced the amount of light flashing when shooting TP82 Increased per bullet damage from 2 to 3 Shotgun Increased per bullet damage from 4 to 5 Plasma Gun Increased reserved ammo from 50 to 250 </description>
