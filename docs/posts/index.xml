      <description>A guide for gamedevs to create professional looking website that are highly customizable and can be easily scaled out for features.
Oh hey, you can look at ours as an example
TLDR The Problem Many website builders, while easy to build, are financially costly. But building a website from scratch has a high effort cost.
Solution Use a static website generator like Hugo hosted on GitHub Pages for a no financial and low effort cost website.</description>

      <description>Thank you all that signed up for RBA open playtesting &amp;lt;3! The amount of players that signed up for playtesting is far more than we initially expected. We are excited to announce that we will begin letting in players within the following week or two. We will continue to let more and more players in as time progresses. We want to make sure there are not any game breaking bugs before mass open playtesting (trust me there are plenty of non game breaking bugs at the moment :D).</description>

      <title>Walking Into Doors</title>

      <description>So we just had our first playtest. Watching others play our game was a lot more fun than I anticipated. We also gain a lot more insight into our own assumptions and understanding of our game.
One hilarious design flaw we discovered: player&amp;rsquo;s have trouble walking through doors.</description>

      <title>Progression of Colors</title>

      <description>I find it hard to consider myself an artist. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been drawn to coding and building before what I consider traditional art. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in art, but never thought I was any good. I find, generally, that my art practices mimic my coding practices: I often start with abstract ideas then slowly progress to a well defined final product. I enjoy demonstrating that some idea has value: that a single idea might house value without investing an overbearing amount of resources to demonstrate said value.</description>
