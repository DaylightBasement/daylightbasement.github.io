      <description>A guide for gamedevs to create professional looking website that are highly customizable and can be easily scaled out for features.
Oh hey, you can look at ours as an example
TLDR The Problem Many website builders, while easy to build, are financially costly. But building a website from scratch has a high effort cost.
Solution Use a static website generator like Hugo hosted on GitHub Pages for a no financial and low effort cost website.</description>

      <description>Known Issues Keyboard and mouse can only be used if the controller is unplugged. If controller is plugged in, it takes priority Hot swapping controller/keyboard will probably not work. We have only tested an xbox controller Some players may experience lower than expected framerate. There are known things we can improve and hope to fix them soon. We&amp;rsquo;ve tested on a GTX 970 and that seems fine. There is no quit button, so alt-tab or alt+F4 to close the game game only supports 16:10 and 16:9 resolutions UI Overall Improved look of health bars Holster added back to the player hud Improved minimap look Updated a lot of music Fixed screen effects in menu when loading in the the game for the first time Added a notification for when the player runs out of Radar Jam Fixed travel events Player can no longer re-board visited nodes Weapons and Items Overall Fixed a bug around weapons being duplicated with a controller Calamities Now reset upon death ProÕûoves Reduced cost of all ProÕûoves to 1 RunTime ProÕûoves granted within a given run are now called RunTimes Now reset upon death (ProÕûoves gained still carry over from run to run) Radar Jam Reduced the amount of starting radarjam from 250 to 150 Reduced the amount picked up from 100 to 50 PPSH41 Increased reserved ammo amount from 100 to 850 Reduced the amount of light flashing when shooting TP82 Increased per bullet damage from 2 to 3 Shotgun Increased per bullet damage from 4 to 5 Plasma Gun Increased reserved ammo from 50 to 250 </description>

      <description>Thank you all that signed up for RBA open playtesting &amp;lt;3! The amount of players that signed up for playtesting is far more than we initially expected. We are excited to announce that we will begin letting in players within the following week or two. We will continue to let more and more players in as time progresses. We want to make sure there are not any game breaking bugs before mass open playtesting (trust me there are plenty of non game breaking bugs at the moment :D).</description>

      <description>So we just had our first playtest. Watching others play our game was a lot more fun than I anticipated. We also gain a lot more insight into our own assumptions and understanding of our game.
One hilarious design flaw we discovered: player&amp;rsquo;s have trouble walking through doors.</description>

      <description>I find it hard to consider myself an artist. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been drawn to coding and building before what I consider traditional art. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in art, but never thought I was any good. I find, generally, that my art practices mimic my coding practices: I often start with abstract ideas then slowly progress to a well defined final product. I enjoy demonstrating that some idea has value: that a single idea might house value without investing an overbearing amount of resources to demonstrate said value.</description>

      <description>Rightfully, Beary Arms is a bullet hell roguelite that is about much more than collecting loot, dying and losing everything, then repeating. Carefully choose enemy upgrades against your own, then plan your dungeon crawl tactfully to gun through unique factions of enemies, strategically preserving loot after death.
Video not supportedBeary likes to fight. His arsenal is vast but displaced throughout the galaxy. Collect and use powerful weapons, each with their own unique characteristics and learning curves.</description>
