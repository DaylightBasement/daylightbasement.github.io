      <description>I find it hard to consider myself an artist. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been drawn to coding and building before what I consider traditional art. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in art, but never thought I was any good. I find, generally, that my art practices mimic my coding practices: I often start with abstract ideas then slowly progress to a well defined final product. I enjoy demonstrating that some idea has value: that a single idea might house value without investing an overbearing amount of resources to demonstrate said value.</description>
