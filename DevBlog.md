## Progression of colors

### 2020/17/06

I find it hard to consider myself an artist. I've always been drawn to coding and building before what I consider traditional art. I've always had an interest in art, but never thought I was any good. Not sure how the next thoughts relate, but it seems like a transition I want to make. I find, generally, that my art practices mimic my coding practing: I often start with abstract ideas then slowly progress to a well defined final products. I enjoy demonstrating that some idea has value: That a single idea might work with multitudes of other ideas without investing an overbearing amount of reasources to demostrate said idea has value. I still have a lot to learn with art and game design though. I think reflecting aids in learning but also leads to appreciation. It is nice to reflect on the abstract ideas that we shared at the start of this project then watch thos ideas manifest into a well defined minimal viable product of a game.

We aimed for a post modernism color pallet. It started by agreeing on a color climate, which slowly progressed into mock ups, then the final game art seen below.
