## Progression of Colors

### 2020/06/17

I find it hard to consider myself an artist. I've always been drawn to coding and building before what I consider traditional art. I've always had an interest in art, but never thought I was any good. I find, generally, that my art practices mimic my coding practices: I often start with abstract ideas then slowly progress to a well defined final product. I enjoy demonstrating that some idea has value: that a single idea might might demostrate value without investing an overbearing amount of resources to demostrate said value. I still have a lot to learn with art and game design, though. 

I think reflecting aids in learning, and also leads to appreciation. It is nice to reflect on the abstract ideas that were shared at the start of this project then watch those ideas manifest into a minimal viable product of a game. We aimed for a post modernism color pallet. We started by agreeing on a color climate, which slowly progressed into mock ups, then the final game art seen below.
