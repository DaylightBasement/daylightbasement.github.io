Thank you all that signed up for RBA open playtesting <3! The amount of players that signed up for playtesting is far more than we initially expected. We are excited to announce that we will begin letting in players within the following week or two. We will continue to let more and more players in as time progresses. We want to make sure there are not any game breaking bugs before mass open playtesting (trust me there are plenty of non game breaking bugs at the moment :D). Please provide any feedback to our steam community or our [discord](https://discord.gg/5RmvYfN). I hope to provide a post of known bugs or features that are not implemented before we open playtest to the public.

Also if you are going to PAX East 2022, feel free to stop by our booth! We would love to chat with you.


Rightfully,

Chris 🐻
