Don’t be fooled by its cuteness. _Rightfully, Beary Arms_ is a bullet hell, roguelite that will punish and reward you. Augment weapons to create unique weapon builds, pick rewards as you explore levels, alter mechanics to your benefit and peril, fight, die, become stronger, and do it all over again.


![dream your rules](/rba/headers/game-desc-header-dream-rules.png)

Manipulate the rules of the game by collecting runtimes, and calamities. Make things easier for Beary, harder for the enemy, or even harder for you.


![Warp your weapons](/rba/headers/game-desc-header-warp-your-weapons.png)

Warp your weapons and completely transform them with weapon augmentations. Add new functionality, or alter existing functionality. Experiment and create unique builds and synergies.

![Choose your outcomes](/rba/headers/game-desc-header-choose-your-outcomes.png)

As you travel through the realms of the dreamscape, decide how to be rewarded.

![Become unstoppable](/rba/headers/game-desc-header-become-unstoppable.png)

Dying isn’t all for nought. Collect inspiration to become stronger with each death until your enemies have no choice but to bow down to your awesomeness as you wreak havoc and become unstoppable.
