## UI
- Reduced some of the gun shooting flashes
- Pressing `esc` now allows the player to quit or return to the title screen
- Smoother camera movement with a controller (Thanks for the feedback @adli_hm üìù)
- Fixed bugs around being able to drop weapons with a controller. These bugs were likely the cause of another bug that would result in the player not being able to shoot (Thanks to Metal Bat for reporting this <3)
- Added resource definitions to the game info screen (next to the settings) 

## Weapons and Items

### Boxes
- Fixed a bug where a particular room would drop a unlimited amount of Plu (Thank you @ParkAttack for finding this one)

### TP82
- Increased mag size from 3 to 4
- Increased rate of fire
- Increased ammo pickup from 50 to 96

## Nav
- Fixed a bug where some rooms only had a single enemy spawn point
