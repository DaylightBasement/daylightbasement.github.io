# Known Issues

- Keyboard and mouse can only be used if the controller is unplugged. If controller is plugged in, it takes priority
- Hot swapping controller/keyboard will probably not work.
- We have only tested an Xbox controller
- Framerate isn't great. We are doing some things not as optimally as we should be, we've tested on gtx 970 and that seems to play fine. We should have a fix for this soon
- There is no quit button, so alt-tab or alt+F4 to close the game
- game only supports 16:10 and 16:9 resolutions
